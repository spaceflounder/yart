  {{ilsa.DefiniteArticle}} sat at the counter with a steaming cup of tea and a 
  black fountain pen. The letter before her was already a couple of pages,
  and long, flowing script continued to flow from her wrinkled hand.

      {{ilsa.DefiniteArticle}} had olive skin, and her hair was mostly dark
      brown with long streaks of white. There was a modest wooden cross hanging from her neck.
      The letter seemed to be for a nun in a distant convent, and was littered with
      Biblical passages.

      "Have a nice trip home," I said, getting up from the counter.

      "Pleasure to chat with you," said Ilsa.

      I considered ordering some breakfast myself, but wasn't exactly hungry, and
      a simple journalist cannot afford too many indulgences whilst abroad.

      "Good morning," I said. "My name is Victoria."

      She glanced up from her writing with a haggard grin. "Nice to meet you. My
      name is Ilsa."

        "I'm a reporter with the New York Times, from America," I said. "Where
        are you from?"

        "Rome, originally," responded Ilsa. "I'm headed back to my convent now,
        near Zumpano in southern Italy."

        "Black English breakfast," said Ilsa. "No cream. Cream at this hour gives me
        rheumatism."

        "Whom are you writing a letter to?" I asked.

        "An old friend," she said. "I meant to see her on this trip but
        she was quite ill." She took another sip of tea.

        "I'm sorry to hear that," I said.

        "When we were young, we were very close," said Ilsa. "Now we are old
        and time has taken it's toll."
